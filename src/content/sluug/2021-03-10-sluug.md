## **MAIN:** The Raku (Perl 6) language

**By:** Steven Lembark

"Hypers and Gathers and Takes! Oh my!"

Raku is the new name (since 2019) for Perl 6 (out since 2015). Perl 6 took YEARS in anticipation and when it finally came out, it was very different from older versions of Perl. So much so, they gave up on the name Perl 6 and just went with a new name, RAKU.

## **BASE:** 1Password

**By:** Scott Granneman

A password manager that works on Android, Chrome OS, iOS, macOS, MS Windows, and works with browsers Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, and Safari.
